For Windows:

1. Download Python 3.5+ below:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Customize installation with Python 3 and then checked "pip" to install pip

3. Install pygame with command below:
py -3 -m pip install pygame

4. Change to game directory

5. Try to execute darkchess.py:
py -3 darkchess.py

For Linux:

Almost the same step as windows,
but you need replace "py -3 -m pip install pygame" with
"pip3 install pygame" in step 3.
And replace "py -3 darkchess.py" with "python3 darkchess.py" in step 5.
